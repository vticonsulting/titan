# Elements
# Elements

Elements utilize decisions made on the token level. A simple example of an element would be a button, a link, or an input. Anything that cannot be broken down further. I use the name ‘element’ since everything in Vue and React world is nowadays ‘a component.’ Using that term for anything else would be confusing.
