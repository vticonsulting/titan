# Patterns

Patterns are UI Patterns that fall on the more complex side of the spectrum. So for example things like a date picker, a data table, or a visualization. Patterns utilize both elements and tokens. If you wonder whether something should be called an element or a pattern, ask yourself this question: _“Can this be broken down into smaller pieces?”_ If the answer is yes, it should most likely be a pattern in Vue Design System.
