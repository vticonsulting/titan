Title: The 4 Disciplines of Execution

----

Text:

## Focus on the Wildly Important

Exceptional execution starts with narrowing the focusâ€” clearly identifying what must be done, or nothing else you achieve really matters much. 

> "If every other area of our operation remained at its current level of performance, what is the one area where change would have the greatest impact?"

- Compelling vision / achievable goal
- To facilate radical generosity

## Act on the Lead Measures

Twenty percent of activities produce eighty percent of results. The highest predictors of goal achievement are the 80/20 activities that are identified and codified into individual actions and tracked fanatically. 

## Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

People and teams play differently when they are keeping score, and the right kind of scoreboards motivate the players to win. 

## Create a Cadence of Accountability

Great performers thrive in a culture of accountability that is frequent, positive, and self-directed. Each team engages in a simple weekly process that highlights successes, analyzes failures, and course-corrects as necessary, creating the ultimate performance-management system.
